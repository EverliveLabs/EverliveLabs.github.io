        <h1>About Everlive Labs</h1>
        <p>Everlive Labs is a digital product studio dedicated to crafting software that feels like an extension of your
            mind. We believe in the power of native, lightweight applications that respect your system resources and
            your attention.</p>
        <p>Our flagship product, Optimal Desktop, was born out of a frustration with bloated, slow productivity tools.
            We wanted something that is there on the desktop to see at a glance but never gets in the workflow. It
            started with the basic idea of sticking a simple, elegant interface to the desktop just like sticky notes.
        </p>
        <p>We combine creativity, design, and precision to build tools for the modern creative professional.</p>
